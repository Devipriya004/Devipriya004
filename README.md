- 👋 Hi, I’m @Devipriya004
- 🧠 I work at the intersection of strategy, customer experience, and operations at an early-stage startup
- 🎯 I enjoy solving messy, real-world problems with a mix of systems thinking and scrappy execution
- 🎨 I have a soft spot for clean design, intuitive UX, and all things front-end
- 🛠️ Currently learning to build small tools to automate everyday workflows
- 🤝 Always up for conversations around product, design, or operations—or to collaborate on something meaningful
